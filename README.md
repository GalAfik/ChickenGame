# ChickenGame
Game Design Doc

The player takes control of a farm chicken as she tries to rescue her lost chicks. The game takes the player through various areas within the large, open world.

Goal: The player must collect all 120 chicks hidden throughout the world while avoiding and defeating various monster-like enemies.

Current planned level:
1. Farmyard (Central Hub) - Tutorial section and collectible hub. This is where players may speak with NPC farm animals to query their collection stats.
2. Forest (North)
3. Cropfields (South)
4. Canyon (West)
5. Construction Yard/River (East)
6. Forest Revisted (North-East)
7. Town (South-East)

Current planned power-ups:
1. Shoot Eggs - This is a core mechanic of the game and will be unlocked during the tutorial. The chicken will shoot eggs backwards into enemies and targets to interact with the world.
2. Dash - This skill will be unlocked after completing the forest level and allow the player to dash for short distances to avoid enemies and dangerous obstacles, such as tractors and cars.
3. Glide - This skill will be awarded to players who finish the crops level. When jumping, the player will glide for short distances.
4. Swim - This skill will be unlocked oncee the Canyon level has been completed. Players will now be able to swim across rivers and bodies of water, allowing them to enter the construction yard and cross the river in the forest.
5. Bawk - As the name implies, this ability allows the player to squak with the mighty force of the Gods! This can be used as an attack, as well as to push heavy objects and opeen the gate to the farm in the South-eastern Cropfield, allowing access to town, the final level of the game.
6. Super Mode - After collecting a Corn item, the player will turn red and gain speed for a short duration.

Horse - Show collection and game stats.

Cow - Show gameplay tutorials and allow the player to replay the tutorial stage.

Pig - ?

Chicken - Allow the player to change skins, once unlocked (by collecting enough chicks).
